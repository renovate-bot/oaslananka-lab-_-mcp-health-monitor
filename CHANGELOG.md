## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.3] - 2026-04-08

### Fixed

- Upgraded `better-sqlite3` to `12.8.0` to avoid native install failures on Node 24 environments

## [1.0.2] - 2026-04-08

### Changed

- Refreshed the locked Hono runtime dependencies to patched releases that resolve the current GitHub Dependabot moderate advisories
- Updated the ESLint 9 toolchain to a patched release line that clears the current `@eslint/plugin-kit` advisory

### Security

- Resolved the `hono` cookie, IP restriction, path traversal, and `serveStatic` advisory set by moving to patched transitive versions
- Resolved the `@hono/node-server` `serveStatic` middleware bypass advisory
- Resolved the `@eslint/plugin-kit` ReDoS advisory through the patched ESLint 9 line

- Markdown `get_report` tool for copy-pasteable health reporting
- P50 and P95 latency reporting in uptime and dashboard responses

- `/health` HTTP endpoint plus in-memory rate limiting for the HTTP server
- Integration tests, scheduler tests, migration tests, retry tests, and HTTP server tests
- `SECURITY.md` with private vulnerability reporting guidance
- `ROADMAP.md`, `.env.example`, and `renovate.json` for repo governance and maintenance
- Internal webhook delivery helper with optional HMAC-SHA256 signing

- Webhook docs now distinguish the internal helper from the still-planned public webhook tooling
- Registry-facing `mcpName` now uses the GitHub-auth namespace form `io.github.oaslananka/mcp-health-monitor`

### Security

- Clarified that Azure DevOps PAT storage is base64 encoding, not encryption
- Moved vulnerability disclosure policy to `SECURITY.md` and removed public issue guidance
